CodeIgniter 4 Framework
Training for Trainers on PHP Web Application Framework: CodeIgniter
This project is a requirement for the completion of the training. It focuses on developing an Inventory System Module for AIS. The project utilizes the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture of CodeIgniter and incorporates Bootstrap as the main CSS framework for templating.

Inventory System Module of Academic Information System
Technical Aspects and Overview
The Inventory System Module is structured to cover various components critical to inventory management:

Users: Handles user management, listing employees and managing user accounts.
Items: Stores detailed information about each inventory item, facilitating easy access and management.
Categories: Organizes items into categories, allowing for streamlined management and retrieval.
Suppliers: Maintains a database of suppliers, including their contact details and other relevant information.
Inventory Transactions: Records and tracks changes in inventory, such as purchases, sales, and adjustments.
Item Locations: Tracks the location of items, essential for inventory spread across multiple locations.
Assignments: Manages the assignment of items to employees, using Memorandum Receipts (MR) to document item issuance.
Key Technologies and Methodologies
CodeIgniter Framework: Utilizes CodeIgniter, a lightweight PHP framework, providing a structured yet flexible environment. Its simplicity and performance make it well-suited for building robust web applications.

Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:

Model: Manages data and business logic, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on inventory items, categories, users, and suppliers.
View: Handles the presentation layer, providing a user interface for interacting with the system through forms, tables, and reports.
Controller: Acts as an intermediary, processing user inputs and determining the appropriate responses or views to render.
Bootstrap for Responsive Design: Ensures a responsive, mobile-first design, providing a consistent and user-friendly interface across various devices and screen sizes.

CRUD Operations: Comprehensive CRUD operations allow users to create, read, update, and delete records in the system, maintaining accurate and up-to-date inventory data.

Form Validation: Includes robust form validation to ensure data integrity, checking for required fields, correct formats, and valid data types using CodeIgniter's validation library.

Authentication: Implements user authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify inventory data, protecting the system's integrity and confidentiality.

Data Encryption: Uses secure hashing algorithms to encrypt sensitive data, such as user passwords, before storing them in the database, enhancing data security.

MySQL Database: The backend relies on a MySQL database, known for its reliability and efficiency in managing relational data, handling data storage, retrieval, and complex queries.

Chart.js for Reporting: Integrates Chart.js to create interactive and insightful charts, providing visual representations of inventory trends, transaction histories, and other key metrics, aiding in data-driven decision-making.

By combining these technologies and practices, the Inventory System Module ensures efficient, secure, and user-friendly management of inventory, paving the way for seamless integration into the institution's broader Academic Information System.
